# Progress

## Setup
Booted up mayfly
compiled code and sent to mayfly
figured out library management using platformio
blinked LED using RTC temperature threshold
Connected ISCO to Mayfly switched power 5v -> signal (yellow) and 12v -> power (red)
>>> YOU ARE HERE Triggered ISCO sample using mayfly temp-trigger-led.ino

## Using Mayfly as datalogger
write a Log temperature and trigger ISCO program (eventually to SD card)
    - Use example simple_logger.ino in ModularSensors as a guide
Figure out how to write files to SD card
Figure out sleep modes (low priority)




## Sonde Library Business:
Connect sonde to mayfly
Read about SDI-12 libraries for other SDI-12 sensors in ModularSensors repository (menu a la carte)
Make a sonde library using SDI-12 libraries as template
Figure out sampling thresholds



## Deployment
Waterproofing housing
battery supply testing
